## **Revenue and Shipment Trends**
- **Revenue Fluctuation:** Monthly revenue ranges between **$109,967 (Feb)** and **$156,586 (May)**, with peaks during **March–May** and **November–December** — likely reflecting seasonal demand.  
- **Shipment Volume:** Monthly shipments average around **400**, with consistent activity throughout the year, suggesting stable supply chain performance.  
- **Product Category Contribution:**  
  - **Electronics:** 68% of total revenue, remaining the top-performing segment
  - **Audio Equipment:** 51%  
  - **Computing:** 34%  
  - **Office Equipment:** 18%

## **Delivery Performance**
- **Average Delivery Time:** 10 days overall, with significant variation across regions.  
- **Longest Delivery Times:**  
  - **Australia (20 days)**  
  - **Japan (18 days)**  
  - **China (15 days)**  
- **Shortest Delivery Times:**  
  - **USA (1 day)**  
  - **Canada (2 days)**  
  - **Brazil (4 days)**  

Regional disparities in delivery times highlight logistics inefficiencies in Asia-Pacific markets. Streamlining operations in those regions could enhance delivery reliability and customer satisfaction.

## **Sales Team Performance**
Top-performing sales representatives by shipment completion:
- **Bonnie Lucero:** 286 shipments (179 completed, 19 returned)  
- **Erin Arnold:** 268 shipments (160 completed, 10 returned)  
- **Brandon Richards:** 268 shipments (166 completed, 15 returned)  
- **Stacey Brown:** 264 shipments (155 completed, 8 returned)  

While sales volume is evenly distributed, variation in return rates (ranging from 3% to 7%) suggests differences in post-sale support or product quality. Continued monitoring of salesperson-specific returns can help identify best practices.

---

## **Key Insights**
1. **Steady operational flow** with consistent shipment volume throughout the year.  
2. **Revenue peaks in Q2 and Q4**, aligning with potential promotional or seasonal cycles.  
3. **Return rate (5%)** is moderate but could be reduced with improved quality assurance.  
4. **Delivery inefficiencies** are concentrated in Asia-Pacific, with significantly longer fulfillment times.  
5. **Electronics dominate sales**, but diversification into other product categories could mitigate market dependency.
